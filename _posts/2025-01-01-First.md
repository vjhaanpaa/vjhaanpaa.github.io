# J2025.0

As everything online is undergoing enshittification, I decided to create this simple distraction-free site for hosting some small guides and notes, etc. Maybe some of this stuff will be helpful to somebody.

There is otherwise no major plan for the site. It will likely contain some collected thoughts on various topics and in general just be place to store some small notes that I will forget about by the time I next need them.

# Potential and Likely Post Topics

In the last year, a lot of my free time has revolved around:

- fixing things around the house
- fixing and messing around with old handheld consoles and other 90's - 00's hardware
- working on miniature wargaming things
- 3D printing (usually something related to the above three points)

The things I will write about will most likely be related to the above topics. I might end up just journaling things here, if this whole Github Pages setup works effortlessly enough.

Or maybe this whole things just dies before it gets going.
